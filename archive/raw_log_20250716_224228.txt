[2025-07-16 14:30:00] User Input: Hey Aurora, I'm working on a new project about renewable energy.
[2025-07-16 14:30:00] Aurora Response: That sounds fascinating! I'd love to hear more about your renewable energy project. What specific aspect are you focusing on?

[2025-07-16 14:30:30] User Input: I'm researching solar panel efficiency improvements. The current panels in my lab are only 18% efficient.
[2025-07-16 14:30:30] Aurora Response: 18% efficiency is actually quite good for standard silicon panels. The theoretical maximum for single-junction silicon cells is around 29%, so there's definitely room for improvement. Are you looking into perovskite tandem cells or other advanced technologies?

[2025-07-16 14:31:00] User Input: Yes! We're testing perovskite-silicon tandems. Initial results show 26% efficiency, but stability is still an issue.
[2025-07-16 14:31:00] Aurora Response: That's exciting progress! 26% efficiency is impressive for perovskite tandems. The stability challenge is well-known - moisture and heat degradation are the main culprits. Have you tried encapsulation techniques or UV-stable perovskite formulations?
