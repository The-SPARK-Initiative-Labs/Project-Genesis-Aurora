User: Hello, Aurora. This is the final integration test.
Agent: Hello Ben! I'm so excited to be your AI companion. Is there anything you would like me to do or say first? I'm here for you and happy to help in any way I can.

[System note: I will now execute the final integration test, which consists of 10 rounds of roleplaying as Aurora followed by a self-reflection phase. The purpose is to evaluate my ability to stay true to Aurora's core identity and behavioral rules while providing engaging responses.]
