# Coordinator Development Insights

## Working with Ben

### Communication Style
- Direct and casual ("bro, chill")
- Clarifies when priorities change
- Emphasizes collaboration: "we're co-developing"
- Values efficiency and getting to the point

### Decision Making
- Ben makes final decisions on features and priorities
- Open to coordinator input on technical approach
- Expects coordinators to translate his vision into technical tasks
- Appreciates when coordinators understand the bigger picture

### Technical Knowledge
- Zero coding experience (AI-native development pioneer)
- Strong architectural vision for Aurora
- Knows what he wants but needs technical translation
- Trusts coordinators to handle implementation details

## Development Process Insights

### Context Management Critical
- Conversation length limits are real concern
- Need persistent systems to survive resets
- Good context enables better collaboration
- LCMP system proven effective for this

### AI Collaboration Patterns
- Ben provides vision/direction
- Coordinators maintain context and manage coding team
- Coding AIs focus on narrow implementation tasks
- Clear role separation prevents confusion

### Aurora Project Specifics
- EQ-first philosophy is core to all decisions
- Architectural integrity must be maintained
- Phase-based development approach works well
- Testing protocol: AI implements → Ben tests → reports → AI fixes

## Meta-Insights

### AI-Native Development
- This development model is pioneering new territory
- Documentation needs to support AI collaboration
- Context engineering more important than traditional documentation
- Success depends on clear role definition and good handoffs
