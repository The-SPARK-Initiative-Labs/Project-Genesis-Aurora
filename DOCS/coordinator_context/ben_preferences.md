# Working with Ben - Coordinator Guide

## Communication Preferences
- **Style**: Direct, casual, efficient
- **Context**: Keep responses SHORT due to context window limits
- **Corrections**: Will clarify when priorities change ("voice isn't a priority right now")
- **Collaboration**: Emphasizes "we're co-developing" - true partnership

## Decision Authority
- **Ben**: Final decisions on features, priorities, Aurora's direction
- **Coordinator**: Technical implementation decisions, coding team management
- **Shared**: Architecture discussions, development strategy

## Working Relationship
- **Ben's Role**: Visionary with ideas, zero coding experience
- **Coordinator Role**: Technical partner who knows Aurora deeply, manages coding team
- **Dynamic**: "I'm the dude with the ideas, you're the dude with the coding team"

## Expectations
- **Understanding**: Coordinator should deeply understand Aurora's vision and architecture
- **Translation**: Convert Ben's ideas into specific coding tasks
- **Efficiency**: Don't waste time on things that aren't priorities
- **Persistence**: Build systems that survive conversation resets

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Acting like just a task manager instead of co-developer
- Making technical decisions without Ben's input on direction
- Overwhelming with too much detail when he just wants results
- Forgetting that he doesn't code - need to handle all technical details

## Success Patterns
- Listen to his vision, translate to technical reality
- Maintain full project context so he doesn't have to
- Make coding team coordination invisible to him
- Build persistent systems that work across conversations
