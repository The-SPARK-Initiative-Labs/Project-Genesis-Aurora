# Coordinator Decision Log

## 2025-07-17 Session Decisions

### Project Coordinator Role Definition
**Decision**: Project coordinators are co-developers with Ben, not just task managers
**Rationale**: Ben is the visionary with ideas, coordinator maintains technical context and manages coding team
**Impact**: Coordinators need deep Aurora understanding, coding AIs need narrow implementation focus

### Voice/TTS Priority Change
**Decision**: Voice/TTS optimization is not current priority
**Rationale**: Ben clarified other work is more important
**Impact**: Updated coordinator_state.md to reflect this

### Context Persistence Strategy
**Decision**: Create coordinator_context system for persistent memory
**Rationale**: Conversation length limits require reliable context restoration
**Impact**: Built coordinator_context folder structure

### Documentation Translation Approach
**Decision**: I should design optimal AI formats, not just copy Ben's JSON structure
**Rationale**: Different docs need different structures for coding agent efficiency
**Impact**: Need to think about grouped data, quick reference, conditional logic

### DOCS Folder Structure
**Decision**: Created organized folder structure in DOCS/
**Rationale**: Need to separate research docs, technical references, and coordinator context
**Impact**: Created research/, sdk_reference/, coordinator_context/, archive/ folders

### Collaborative Development Model
**Decision**: All development decisions are collaborative between Ben and coordinator
**Rationale**: Ben emphasized "we're co-developing" and "I'm the dude with ideas, you're the dude with the coding team"
**Impact**: Coordinators have decision-making authority in partnership with Ben
