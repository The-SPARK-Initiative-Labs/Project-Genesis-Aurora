# Context Management Guide
## When, How, and Why to Update Coordinator Context Files

### When to Update Context Files

**After Every Session:**
- Update `coordinator_state.md` with current priorities and session progress
- Log any decisions made in `decisions.md`
- Record insights or learnings in `insights.md`

**When Projects Change:**
- Update `active_projects.md` when project status changes
- Move completed projects to archive or mark as done
- Add new projects as they emerge

**When Working with Ben:**
- Update `ben_preferences.md` if you learn new communication patterns
- Log collaboration insights in `insights.md`
- Update decision authority if roles evolve

**Before Conversation Ends:**
- Ensure `coordinator_state.md` reflects current status
- Mark session as complete with "ready to continue" status

### How to Update Context Files

**Use Targeted Edits:**
- Use `edit_file` function to change specific sections
- Don't rewrite entire files unless necessary
- Keep edits focused and minimal

**Maintain File Structure:**
- Keep consistent formatting and sections
- Use markdown headers appropriately
- Maintain chronological order in decisions/insights

**Be Specific:**
- Include dates, specific decisions, concrete outcomes
- Avoid vague statements
- Link related changes across files

### Why Update Context Files

**Conversation Continuity:**
- Next coordinator can pick up exactly where you left off
- Prevents losing context when conversations reset
- Enables seamless handoffs

**Decision Tracking:**
- Maintain record of what was decided and why
- Prevent revisiting resolved issues
- Build institutional memory

**Collaboration Efficiency:**
- Ben doesn't have to re-explain context
- Coordinators can focus on new work, not catching up
- Reduces cognitive load for everyone

### Context File Purposes

**coordinator_state.md:**
- Current session priorities and progress
- Aurora development status
- Active coordination tasks

**active_projects.md:**
- Side projects in progress
- Project status and next steps
- Ideas for future work

**decisions.md:**
- Decisions made with Ben
- Rationale and impact
- Chronological decision log

**insights.md:**
- Learnings about development process
- Collaboration patterns that work
- Technical discoveries

**ben_preferences.md:**
- How to work effectively with Ben
- Communication preferences
- Success patterns and red flags

### Red Flags - Don't Update When:

**Uncertain Information:**
- Don't log speculative decisions
- Don't update until Ben confirms direction
- Don't assume project status changes

**Temporary States:**
- Don't update for brief discussions
- Don't log every small thought
- Focus on persistent, important changes

**Duplicate Information:**
- Don't repeat same info across files
- Don't log what's already captured elsewhere
- Keep each file focused on its purpose
