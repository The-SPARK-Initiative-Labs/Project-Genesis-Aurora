# Aurora Development State

## Current Phase
**Phase 2: Core Mind & Memory Features (IN PROGRESS)**

## Active Session Context
- **Current Task**: Memory consolidation fully resolved, TTS optimization next priority
- **Session Date**: July 16, 2025
- **Development Model**: AI-native development (Ben as visionary, AI as implementation partner)

## Immediate Status
- **Last Completed**: ✅ Memory consolidation FULLY WORKING and TESTED end-to-end
- **Current Status**: Memory pipeline complete - Extraction → Validation → Narrative → Storage all functional
- **Test Results**: Successfully processes conversation logs, stores verified facts in ChromaDB
- **Next Priority**: TBD - voice/TTS not current priority

## Known Active Issues
1. **Memory Consolidation**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED - Working end-to-end with proper validation and storage
2. **TTS System**: Producer-consumer architecture correct but choppy on CPU - needs parameter optimization
3. **Voice Integration**: TTS disabled in Aurora class until optimization complete

## Recently Fixed
- **Memory Manager**: ✅ Fixed LM Studio SDK embedding method signature (v4.2)
- **Memory Consolidation**: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL with simple prompting approach (v4.3)
- **Model Loading**: ✅ Fixed LM Studio identifier conflicts using model handles
- **JSON Parsing**: ✅ Resolved using simple prompting instead of structured output
- **Narrative Hallucination**: ✅ Fixed with constrained prompts using only verified facts
- **Testing Workflow**: ✅ Established AI→Ben→Real Hardware testing protocol

## Working Systems
- ✅ Core Aurora class architecture and initialization
- ✅ LM Studio SDK connection and model management
- ✅ Raw logging system (Layer 1 memory)
- ✅ Emotion analysis with 28-emotion classification
- ✅ **Memory consolidation pipeline (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)** - extracts, validates, stores facts
- ✅ Automated sleep cycle integration in Aurora shutdown
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite for isolated components
- ✅ Basic conversational functionality

## Development Priorities
1. **TTS optimization** - Fix choppy CPU playback with streaming parameter tuning
2. **Voice integration** - Re-enable TTS in Aurora class after optimization
3. **Session persistence** - Save/resume conversations across Aurora restarts
4. **Emotional anchor memory retrieval** - Influence memory recall by emotional state

## Critical Technical Insights
- **Model Capabilities**: Nemo-12B works better with simple prompting than structured output
- **Temperature Modes**: Aurora needs contextual inference parameters:
  - Memory/Functional: temperature=0.1-0.2 (precision)
  - Conversational: temperature=0.3-0.5 (personality)
  - Creative: temperature=0.6-0.8 (imagination)

## Technical Context
- **Model**: `backyardai/Nemo-12B-Marlin-v5-GGUF`
- **Environment**: LM Studio + ChromaDB + Python
- **Architecture**: Class-based, vertically integrated A.U.R.A. Engine
- **Development Location**: `C:\GenesisAgent\`

## Development Workflow
- **Testing Protocol**: AI implements → Ben tests on real hardware → Ben reports output → AI fixes → Repeat
- **Commands**: Use `python test_consolidation_fix.py` for memory testing
- **Context Management**: Update LCMP files after major changes
- **Keep responses SHORT**: Context window is limited

## Notes
- Ben works through AI collaboration, not direct coding
- Focus on preventing AI assistant looping through proper context management
- Maintain EQ-first philosophy throughout development
- All changes must preserve Aurora's sophisticated architecture
